## Summary of Queries

Although there are additional questions on the Jupyter notebook, utliization of the follwoing helped to build visualizations:

1. What are the top ten genres listed for physical books?
2. What were the Top 10 books that had the highest number of people reviewing?
3. Page Count X Rating - Do longer books have a lower rating?
4. What books are listed in both audio and physical? What are the rating for each?
